modules are like functions that let you use some functionality or another like reading or writing to/from a file

"reading a file" means taking the content of a given file and storing that content into memory

.exists(file) -- checks if a file exists
.writeFile(file, data) -- writes "data" to a file

    -- data written to file w/ writeFile has to be string data so use JSON.stringify here??
    -- this is how I'll write my todos to my file
    
.readFile(file) -- reads file to a variable -- what does this mean?
